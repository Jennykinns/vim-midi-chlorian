**Vim-Midi-Chlorian** is a vim plugin for Python autocompletion using
[jedi](https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi)

The main reason I wrote it instead of using the excellent existing
[vim-jedi](https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim) one is that I was unable to
get extra paths included in the autocompletion without using a *virtualenv*
which unfortunately is not available for me on all the machines I work on.

The other reason is that I have just started learning vim and I thought writing
a simple plugin is a great way to learn more about vim. And also, it's great
fun!

Therefore, if you stumbled here, I strongly advise using the above mentioned
plugin, as this one is really designed to fit my needs specifically.
